A cheatsheet for Excel, because although it's mostly straightforward, most people don't take the time to go in depth to learn all the functionality it has.

## Formulas

Every formula has the following 3 parts:

`= Function Name (Arguments)`

Evaluate Formulas: This is a great tool to debug formulas. It's similar to code debugging where you can step in to a formula and see at each step what a formula returns. This can be found at `Formulas` > `Formula Auditing` > `Evaluate Formulas`.
