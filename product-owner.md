# Product Owner

This document outlines notes taken while following the Scrum.org [Product Owner Learning Path](https://www.scrum.org/pathway/product-owner-learning-path/understanding-and-applying-the-scrum-framework/empiricism) and from the Udemy course [Scrum Product Owner Certification Prep](https://www.udemy.com/course/scrum-product-owner-certification-prep-mock-exam-questions/).

## Scrum Artifacts

An artifact is something that is created by the ones using the Scrum framework.

Artifacts represent work and value, and provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

1. Product Backlog
2. Sprint Backlog
3. Increment

## Product Backlog

A list of requirements that contains new features, improvements, fixes, or other changes that need to be done on the product. As long as the product exists, so will its backlog.

Product Backlog Items contain:

- Description
- Order
- Estimate
- Value: Adding story points
- Test description: Helps test if the work performed is completed. Also known as Acceptance Criteria.

The Product Owner is solely responsible of the Product Backlog. He needs to work with the development team closely.

1 Product = 1 Product Owner = 1 Product Backlog

A product backlog is never complete and will always grow and change due to any numerous factors (how the market grows, more requirements, etc.).

### User Stories

**User Stories** are short descriptions of a feature explained from the **perspective of the user.**

User stories are optional in Scrum. They are by no means mandatory.

> As a *kind of user*, I want *some objective* so that *some reason*.

A test description / acceptance criteria will help understand what exactly is expected with this item.

### Backlog Refinement

- It can occur at any time as the Scurm team deems fit.
- It should not occupy more than 10% of the capacity of the Development team.
- The goal of this meeting is to have enough product backlog items at the top of the backlog ready for the next sprint planning.
- The Product Owner and the Development Team ensure the items are small enough to fit into one sprint.
- The top of the list is more refined than those at the bottom.
- The backlog can be changed at any time by the Product Owner.
- The development team is responsible for all estimates and has the final say.

**Backlog Grooming** is an older term that has been deprecated since 2003. The term Refinement is preferred. We say that the Product Backlog is refined rather than groomed.

## Understanding and Applying the Scrum Framework

### Empiricism

Empiricism means working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner. Scrum implements an empirical process where progress is based on observations of reality, not fictitious plans. Scrum also places great emphasis on mind-set and cultural shift to achieve business and organizational Agility.

The three pillars of empiricism are:

![The Three Pillars of Empicism](images/product-owner/pillars-of-empiricism.png)

1. Transparency: We all know what's going on.
2. Inspection: Check your work as you do it.
3. Adaptation: OK to change tactical direction.

An example of empiricism is a **thermostat**.

- Transparency: You can see the desired temperature and the current temperature.
- Inspection: You are able to constantly check the thermostat to ensure it's accurate.
- Adaptation: The termostat will continuously change its temperature to ensure it's accurate.

## Scrum Values

![Scrum Values](images/product-owner/scrum-values.png)

- Courage: Scrum Team members have course to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
- Focus: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.
- Committment: People personally commit to echieving the goals of the Scrum Team.
- Respect: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
- Openness: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.

## Scrum Roles

Scrum standards recommends only [one product owner](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/why-you-need-only-one-product-owner). Downsides of having multiple POs:

- Having many POs encourages micromanagement of teams.
- Many POs requires coordination and alignment.
- Many POs bring unclear responsibility and ownership.

## What is a Sprint Review

This [Sprint Review](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-sprint-review) video explains it very thoroughly, especially about misconceptions and how it should actually be handled.

### Sprint Goal

    The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of a Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

Challenges with the sprint goal:

1. There is no Sprint goal
2. The work is the Sprint goal
3. There is no room for anything else
4. There is no focus on the Sprint goal
5. The goal is not a goal

Examples:

- Implement the functionality for user registration.
- Launch a partnership program for acquiring new clients and increasing the company's earnings.
