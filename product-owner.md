# Product Owner

This document outlines notes taken while following the Scrum.org [Product Owner Learning Path](https://www.scrum.org/pathway/product-owner-learning-path/understanding-and-applying-the-scrum-framework/empiricism).

## Understanding and Applying the Scrum Framework

### Empiricism

Empiricism means working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner. Scrum implements an empirical process where progress is based on observations of reality, not fictitious plans. Scrum also places great emphasis on mind-set and cultural shift to achieve business and organizational Agility.

The three pillars of empiricism are:

![The Three Pillars of Empicism](images/product-owner/pillars-of-empiricism.png)

1. Transparency: We all know what's going on.
2. Inspection: Check your work as you do it.
3. Adaptation: OK to change tactical direction.

An example of empiricism is a **thermostat**. 

- Transparency: You can see the desired temperature and the current temperature.
- Inspection: You are able to constantly check the thermostat to ensure it's accurate.
- Adaptation: The termostat will continuously change its temperature to ensure it's accurate.

## Scrum Values

## Scrum Roles

Scrum standards recommends only [one product owner](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/why-you-need-only-one-product-owner). Downsides of having multiple POs:

- Having many POs encourages micromanagement of teams.
- Many POs requires coordination and alignment.
- Many POs bring unclear responsibility and ownership.

## What is a Sprint Review

This [Sprint Review](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-sprint-review) video explains it very thoroughly, especially about misconceptions and how it should actually be handled.

### Sprint Goal

    The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of a Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

Challenges with the sprint goal:

1. There is no Sprint goal
2. The work is the Sprint goal
3. There is no room for anything else
4. There is no focus on the Sprint goal
5. The goal is not a goal

Examples:

- Implement the functionality for user registration.
- Launch a partnership program for acquiring new clients and increasing the company's earnings.
